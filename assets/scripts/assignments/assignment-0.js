//Create two cariables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choosing) and one that holds no value (e.g. "result").
let UserInput = 64;
let result;

//Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input
result = 18 + UserInput;

//Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable again
result = result - 8;
result = result * 4;
result = result / 2;

//Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change?
  //no, UserInput is still 64

//alert() the result and the user input variables (in two seperate alert() calls).
alert(result);
alert(UserInput);
